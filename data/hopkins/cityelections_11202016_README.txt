\f0\fs24 \cf0 The bulk of analysis in this paper was done using Stata, however R was used for some figures, and all table output was done in Latex. As a result, replication is a bit of a piecemeal process. \
\
Please begin with the Stata .do file- RandR_tablesNew.do. (Note that you\'92ll need to replace all file paths with your own.)\
\
Running that do-file will produce all output for \
\
Table 2\
Table 3\
Table 4\
Table 5\
Table 6\
Table 7\
Table 8\
\
The file Figures.txt has code to replace \
Figure 2\
Figure 3 (R)\
Figure 4\
and Table 10 (R) \
Note that there are extensive notes/annotations. \
